Listerine
==========

Listerine is a fast alternative to acts_as_list because the item that is being inserted or moved is the only one touched.  It does not reorder items below itself.  To do this you need to have a +position+ column defined as a float on the mapped database table.  Then, run a background job nightly to cleanup positions. 


Example
=======

  class TaskList < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tasks, :order => "position"
  end

  class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :task_list
    listerine :tasks, :task_list
  end

  first_task = task_list.tasks.create(:description => 'first task') # inserts item to the bottom of list by default
  first_task.move_to(3) # move to position 3
  first_task.move_to_top # move to top
  first_task.move_to_bottom # move to bottom
